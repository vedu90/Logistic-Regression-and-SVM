# Logistic-Regression-and-SVM
In this assignment, we will extend the rst programming assignment in solving the problem of handwritten
digit classication. In particular, your task is to implement Logistic Regression and use the Support Vector
Machine tool in sklearn.svm.SVM to classify handwritten digit images and compare the performance of
these methods.
To get started with the exercise. you will need to download the supporting les. Unzip its contents to the
directory where you want to complete this assignment.
